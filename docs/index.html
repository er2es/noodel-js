            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Noodel, short for <i>node model</i>, is a UI framework for structuring and presenting content in the modern age.
                    It is based on an interaction scheme that is simple, intuitive, and adaptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently available as Noodel.js, a javascript library. Powered by the reactive view engine of<a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/"> Vue.js</a>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>What can I use it for?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the maximum, Noodel offers a <i>whole new way</i> to structure and present your website or web app
                    that is intuitive and engaging. You can use it for virtually anything - from static blogs and wikis, to dynamic apps with complex control flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the minimum, Noodel is a component you can plug in to an existing web page for an interactive carousel of flexible containers.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                    Noodel requires you to arrange your content into a tree of nodes, where each node contains a distinct
                    chunk of content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your content tree will be presented on an infinite canvas that you can navigate just by
                    moving up, down, left and right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blocks of content will show or hide as you move through the tree, keeping only the relevant
                    subtree visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like an infinite cascade of drop-down menus - only much more elegant and useful.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Why Noodel?</h3>
                <p>
                    Much of the content we encounter everyday naturally comes in tree structures.
                    Trees, however, are difficult to present on a viewing surface. Conventional
                    UI schemes tend to "flatten" trees into linear layouts - the most common offender being
                    long texts with many sections and subsections squashed into a single vertical column.
                    Trying to find the section you want can be an exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is sometimes helped by tables of contents and navigation menus. But
                    such components become hard to use on smaller screens and does not
                    scale well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noodel is a system designed from the ground up that aims to present content in a <i>better</i>
                    way - by providing a user interface that is optimized for content trees, with a lot of
                    considerations thrown in for usability. The result is an intuitive layout that 
                    leverages the spatial memory of the viewer, with an awesome user experience.
                </p>

                <h3>What's so good about it?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Noodel is device-agnostic.</b> The core mechanism and layout remains identical,
                        regardless of screen size and input method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Noodel is accessible.</b> The core mechanism consists only of moving in 4 directions
                        that can be easily adapted to limited-control contexts. In fact, it is possible to build a Noodel site that
                        operates entirely on 4-direction movements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Noodel is flexible.</b> You can apply its chunking and tree recursion capabilities for as little or far as you wish.
                        It doesn't care what you put into each node. The look-and-feel is fully customizable via plain CSS. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Noodel is dynamic.</b> It is more than just a static content viewer, although you can certainly use it that way.
                        You can add, update or delete nodes at any time to deal with asynchronous data or manage control flow. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="noode">
                <h3>TypeScript support</h3>
                <p>
                    Noodel is completely written in TypeScript, with typing support for its API out-of-the-box :)
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Concepts</h2>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Noode</h3>
                <p>
                    The container for a content node in Noodel is called a <i>noode</i> - just like the one you're looking
                    at right now. Noodes are the basic building blocks for your content tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each noode contains a unit of content. It can also have multiple ordered child noodes
                    that have their own unit of sub-content. This can recurse infinitely to form a tree of any size.
                </p>
                <div class="noode">
                    <p>
                        Noodel's core principle is breaking down large streams of content into bite-sized units.
                        A noode should never exceed the size of the viewport - a precondition for node-based navigation.
                    </p>

                <h3>Noodel</h3>
                <p>
                    A <i>noodel</i> (i.e. node model) refers to the whole content tree formed by noodes (nodes).

            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Active child noode</h3>
                <p>
                    If a noode has children, it must have exactly 1 child that's <i>active</i>.
                    The descendents of the active child will be shown while the others hidden.
                </p>

            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Active tree</h3>
                <p>
                    This means that, at any given time, only the children of noodes on the hierarchy 
                    of active noodes starting from the root are shown. This tree of visible
                    content is called the <i>active tree</i>.

                    It is vertical (top to bottom) by default.

                        <p>
                            Noodel comes in two versions, noodel-full.umd.js and noodel.umd.js. The difference is that the
                            full version comes bundled with Vue.js and the base version doesn't.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you use the base version you need to also include Vue.js dependencies for Noodel to work.
                            This prevents including Vue twice if you use Noodel in a Vue project. See Usage with Vue for more details.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For most other use cases you should use the full version as a standalone library.

                        The <i>root</i> parameter is an element selector or object that specifies the root
                        of the content tree, and <i>#target</i> is the target element for placing the noodel.

                    <h3>Defining content tree via HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two ways to define the content tree that will be used by a noodel.
                        For sites driven by static HTML templates, you can define the tree via HTML and
                        give its root element to the constructor:
                    </p>

                                &lt;div class="noode"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;My first noode&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div class="noode"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;My second noode&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;div class="noode"&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;First child of my second noode&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            &lt;script&gt;
                                const noodel = new Noodel("#root");

                        <h3>The specifics</h3>
                        <p>
                            Noodel will traverse the descendents of the root element and convert
                            all <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s with 
                            <code class="language-html">class="noode"</code> into
                            noodes of the noodel, keeping all parent-child relationships. Any text or
                            elements inside a noode that are not child noodes will be treated as the
                            <i>content</i> of that noode, concatenated in the order they appear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This contatenation preserves the markup of content elements
                            so you have complete freedom in structuring and styling the content 
                            of each noode. Note this does not apply
                            to the <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s that serve as
                            placeholders for noodes, as they are not inserted into the final DOM.
                        </p>

                    <div class="noode">
                        <h3>Noodel creates its own DOM subtree</h3>
                        <p>
                            Also note that the original DOM nodes will not be used in the noodel, as a
                            new DOM subtree will be created for it.
                            This means any side effects such as event listeners attached to the original
                            nodes will not be preserved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By mounting a noodel on the root of the original DOM tree (as in the example),
                            the original tree will be destroyed and replaced by that of the noodel. This is usually
                            the behavior you want.

                    <p>
                        Noodel uses Vue internally and therefore provides integration with Vue out-of-the-box.
                        Noodel is available as a Vue component, and also allows you to use Vue components
                        as the content for individual noodes.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Using the base build</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you are including Noodel and Vue's scripts directly in your
                        HTML, it is recommended you use Noodel's base ("Vue-less") build,
                        alongside the Vue build used in your main project (Noodel requires Vue ^2.6.11). 
                        This prevents Vue from being included twice. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are using Noodel as a module
                        from npm, the default entry is the base build and the bundler should be able to load Vue as a dependency. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <p>
                            Noodel only needs Vue's runtime build. But if you need to compile templates in runtime you should include
                            Vue's compiler as appropriate.
                        </p>

                        Noodel's Vue component is exposed as a static variable on the Noodel class, which can be used like any other
                        Vue components. It takes an instance of Noodel as its only prop.

                            Events listeners that listen to focal noode change are useful for triggering effects as noodes
                            enter/leave focus, for example to sync with your own UI elements such as page dots.

                            Note, however, these handlers are called synchronously if triggered by API operations.
                            This means if you call <code class="language-css">moveForward()</code> 3 times in a row

                            <code class="language-css">jumpTo()</code> to trigger these events just once.

                    <h3>Preventing navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        By default, a noodel responds to four types of user input for navigation:
                        swipe/drag, keyboard, scroll wheel, and tap. Navigation will occur even
                        when such input originates from content elements inside noodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This behaviour can be undesirable in situations when you have UI elements that should
                        capture those inputs and prevent them from causing navigation, for example a slider
                        or a textbox.

                    <h3>Prevention classes</h3>
                    <p>
                        To address this issue, Noodel provides the following "prevention classes" that you can 
                        selectively apply to individual elements in your content:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-swipe</code></li>
                        <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-key</code></li>
                        <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-wheel</code></li>
                        <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-tap</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Noodel will ignore the input that originates from an element (or its descendents) with
                        the corresponding prevention class and stops it from triggering any Noodel-specific behaviour.

                    <p>
                        You should use prevention classes sparingly, on elements that really need them. Having large blocks
                        of content with navigation prevention can impact usability, especially on smaller screens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For situations that require extensive navigation prevention, you should rely on the <a href="#inspect-mode-summary">inspect mode</a>
                        instead. Alternatively, you can disable the corresponding input in Noodel's options and provide your
                        own means of navigation via Noodel's API.

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        For swipe-based interfaces such as Noodel, there is always an unresolvable conflict between the swipe
                        mechanism and native conveniences that depend on the same motion, such as text selection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <i>inspect mode</i> is the solution Noodel offers to address this issue. By default, text selection is
                        disabled on a noodel and all input directed towards navigation. Once inspect mode is on, all navigation methods will
                        be suspended and the user is free to select text or perform other conflicting interactions such as drag-and-drop
                        on the focal noode.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is recommended that you rely on inspect mode, in addition to <a href="#prevention-class">prevention classes</a>, to deal with situations
                        where UI elements in your content conflict with Noodel's mechanism.

                    <h3>Inspect mode trigger</h3>
                    <p>
                        The default trigger for inspect mode is the double tap (on any area of the noodel), or the Enter key on a keyboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This trigger has be chosen for maximum convenience and device compatibility, but like anything else it does end up conflicting
                        with interactions such as multiple clicks to select a word/line. If you wish to prevent the default trigger you can
                        always disable it through Noodel's options and provide your own means of toggling inspect mode via Noodel's API 
                        (e.g a custom button).

                        As of Noodel V2, support for custom scrolling inside noodes has been dropped in favor of using the inspect mode to handle
                        content overflow, which provides a more streamlined viewing experience. 
                        Scrolling inside noodes is disabled normally but enabled during inspect mode.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This allows scrolling to be handled by the browser natively, which is a MUCH better idea. 
                        ("Don't mess with scrolling!" is a well-known sentiment, after all.)
                    </p>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <p>
                            Noodel's core principle is content chunking. Because
                            each noode has a limited space, as a general rule, you should try to break down
                            long content into bite-sized pieces that can fit into individual noodes, with responsive styling for
                            different screen sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, this can become impractical in some situations, so inspect mode is provided as a fallback
                            for viewing overflow content.

                            that if the current focal noode is at index 3, and you insert a noode at index 1,
                            the focal noode becomes the noode at index 4, and no navigation will occur.

                            Navigation happens only when a deletion includes the focal noode. In that case the

                    <p>
                        By default, routing is enabled for your noodel. This allows Noodel to control
                        the hash of your URL to sync with the location of the current focal noode.
                        It will use the ID of the focal noode as the fragment identifier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This allows you to use the browser's history navigation to jump between noodes, as well
                        as create URL links that target specific noodes in a noodel.

                            If routing is enabled at a noodel's creation, it will check the URL to focus on
                            an initial target noode, if applicable.

                            The sync between the focal noode and the URL hash happens regardless whether the
                            noodel is in view, i.e. the sync will happen even if you programmatically navigate a noodel
                            while it's unmounted.

                        to replace the URL hash as you navigate around the noodel normally to prevent creating
                        too many unnecessary entries. This includes when you use Noodel's API to navigate.

                    <p>
                        Noodel comes with a basic stylesheet that determines the layout, with a simple greyscale theme.
                        You can extend/override most of Noodel's CSS classes to customize various visual features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In general, however, you should avoid setting properties that relate to layout and positioning, e.g.
                        position, box-sizing, margin and transform, as they may interfere with how Noodel layout and
                        calculates the size of its elements.

                        The size of noodes are determined in a very simple way - they are placed in a
                        basic flex container, so will grow or shrink to fit their content while conforming to the
                        size of siblings, with respect to any CSS height and width properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means you can fully control the size of noodes by setting the height, width, max-height,
                        max-width, min-height and min-width properties on the <code class="language-css">nd-noode</code>
                        class (or on custom class/styles you provide for individual noodes). You can have either fixed size noodes 
                        (by setting a specific width/height) or
                        flexible size noodes (by not setting a specific width/height), and well as using max/min sizes
                        to adapt to a range of situations. In addition, you can set the size of your content element
                        inside a specific noode and let that determine the size of the noode container.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And whenever the size of a noode changes, Noodel will align everything so your
                        focal noode is always centered at the right position!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By default, Noodel comes with a basic <code class="language-css">max-height: 600px</code>
                        and <code class="language-css">max-width: 800px</code> that matches the default size of the canvas,
                        which you can easily override.
                    </p>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <h3>Example: full-page carousel</h3>
                        <p>
                            As an example, it's actually very easy to use Noodel to create the typical full-page
                            carousel site, with some simple CSS overrides:
                        </p>

                            <code class="language-css">

                                    width: 100vw;
                                }

                                .nd-noode {
                                    height: 100vh;
                                    width: 100vw;
                                    margin: 0; /* Removes the "gap" between noodes */
                                }
                            </code>

                    <h3>Controlling animations</h3>
                    <p>
                        All animations are done via CSS transitions. This means you can control
                        the duration and timing functions of all animations via CSS overrides of the corresponding
                        classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        See CSS classes in the API section for the list of classes you can work with.

                        <p>
                            Animation effects during noode insert/delete depend on transitioning the branch
                            and noodes simultaneously. This means they should have identical duration and timing
                            functions - otherwise it will cause a "jump" in the animation.
