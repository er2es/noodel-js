Noodel, short for *node model*, is a user interface that you can navigate with just 4 arrow keys (or 4 direction swipes). It offers a new way to present content on the modern web that is intuitive, responsive and accessible.

## [Demo / documentation](https://zlu883.github.io/Noodel/)

Noodel is self-explanatory: it uses itself to render its own docs ;)

See the link above for everything you need to know!
