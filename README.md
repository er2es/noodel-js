Noodel, short for *node model*, is a 4-way scroll-snap user interface for content trees that you can navigate by simply moving up, down, left and right. It offers a new way to present content that is clean, intuitive, and adaptable.

Noodel is currently available as Noodel.js, an open source JavaScript library for use in web projects.
