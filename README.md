Noodel, short for *node model*, is a 4-way scroll-snap user interface for content trees that you can navigate by simply moving up, down, left and right. It offers a new way to present content in the modern age that is clean, intuitive, and highly adaptable.

Currently available as Noodel.js, a JavaScript component for use in web projects.
