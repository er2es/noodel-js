<img alt="Noodel logo" src="docs/logo_256x256.png" width="90">

Noodel, short for *node model*, is a UI framework for structuring and presenting content in the modern age.
It is based on an interaction scheme that is simple, intuitive, and adaptable.

Currently available as Noodel.js, a JavaScript library. Powered by the reactive view engine of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## What can I use it for?

At the maximum, Noodel offers a *whole new way* to structure and present your website or web app
that is intuitive and engaging. You can use it for virtually anything - from static blogs and wikis, to dynamic apps with complex control flow.

At the minimum, Noodel is a component you can plug in to an existing web page for an interactive carousel of flexible containers.

## Demo and documentation

So, how does it actually work? 

Well, as the ultimate proof of concept, Noodel uses itself to create and present its own docs ;)

[See here for the documentation](https://zlu883.github.io/Noodel/) (and hence live demo).
